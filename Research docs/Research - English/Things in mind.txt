Spring (April – June)
Weather: Mild and pleasant. The country is in bloom.

Highlights: Flowers, city sightseeing, and major festivals like Seville's Feria de Abril and the Semana Santa (Holy Week) processions.

Summer (July – August)
Weather: Hot and lively, especially in the south and interior.

Highlights: Major city festivals like the Running of the Bulls (San Fermín) in Pamplona and La Tomatina, plus vibrant beach life and nightlife.
